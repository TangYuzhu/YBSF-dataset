# YBSF Sea Fog Dataset

## Overview
The YBSF dataset was released in 2022 and is built using Himawari-8 multispectral remote sensing images. It is a high spatial resolution, pixel-level annotated dataset specifically designed for sea fog detection research. The dataset employs multi-class annotations, labeling not only sea fog but also clouds and clear sky, which assists researchers in distinguishing various meteorological phenomena.

## Dataset Details
- **Data Source**: Himawari-8 AHI multispectral images.
- **Spatial Resolution**: All bands are processed to achieve a uniform resolution of 500 meters.
- **Annotation Information**: Pixel-level annotations covering multiple classes, including sea fog, clouds, and clear sky.
- **Sample Quantity**: The dataset contains only 24 sea fog observation events. This limited number is due to the strict criterion requiring the simultaneous presence of sea fog and clouds in the images.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Primarily covers the northern Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea regions (approximately 34째N-42째N, 117째E-127째E).

## Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths
- **High Spatial Resolution**: With a uniform 500-meter resolution, the dataset provides sufficient detail for in-depth analysis.
- **Pixel-Level Annotation**: Detailed annotations facilitate precise model training and evaluation, which is essential for developing high-accuracy sea fog detection algorithms.
- **Multi-Class Annotation**: Including labels for sea fog, clouds, and clear sky helps address the challenge of differentiating sea fog from clouds.

### Limitations
- **Limited Sample Size**: The dataset comprises only 24 sea fog events due to the strict selection criteria requiring both sea fog and clouds to be present simultaneously.
- **Class Imbalance**: The multi-class labeling might result in an uneven distribution of samples between sea fog and non-sea fog areas, requiring careful handling during model training.

## Usage Instructions
Researchers can use the YBSF dataset for:
- Developing and benchmarking sea fog detection algorithms.
- Conducting multi-class remote sensing image segmentation research, particularly in distinguishing sea fog from clouds.
- Environmental monitoring and meteorological forecasting applications.
